# üõ†Ô∏è CRUD Operations with Django ORM

This document contains all four basic CRUD operations performed using Django's ORM in the shell, based on the `Book` model defined in the `bookshelf` app.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Create a Book instance

```python
# Import the model
from bookshelf.models import Book

# Create a Book instance
book = Book.objects.create(
    title="1984",
    author="George Orwell",
    publication_year=1949
)

# Check the created book
print(book)

# Expected Output:
# <Book: 1984 by George Orwell (1949)>
````

---

## üîç 2. Retrieve the Book

```python
# Retrieve the created book
book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")

# Display all attributes
print(book.title)             # Output: 1984
print(book.author)            # Output: George Orwell
print(book.publication_year) # Output: 1949
```

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è 3. Update the Book's Title

```python
# Retrieve and update the book's title
book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")
book.title = "Nineteen Eighty-Four"
book.save()

# Check the updated book
print(book)

# Expected Output:
# <Book: Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell (1949)>
```

---

## ‚ùå 4. Delete the Book

```python
# Retrieve and delete the book
book = Book.objects.get(title="Nineteen Eighty-Four")
book.delete()

# Confirm deletion
print(Book.objects.all())

# Expected Output:
# <QuerySet []>
```
