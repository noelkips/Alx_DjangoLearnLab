## 🎯 Objective

Gain familiarity with **Django** by setting up a development environment and creating a basic project called `LibraryProject`. This will help you understand the Django workflow, project structure, and running a development server.

---

## 📋 Task Overview

You will:

- Install Django
- Create a Django project (`LibraryProject`)
- Run the Django development server
- Explore the default Django project structure

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Basic command-line knowledge

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ 1. Install Django

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install django
````

---

### ✅ 2. Create the Django Project

Generate a new Django project named `LibraryProject`:

```bash
django-admin startproject LibraryProject
```

---

### ✅ 3. Navigate into the Project Directory

```bash
cd LibraryProject
```

---

### ✅ 4. Run the Development Server

Start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit the default Django welcome page in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

You should see a page confirming Django is installed and working.

## 🧱 Project Structure Overview

Once the project is created, here’s what each key file does:

| File/Folder                  | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manage.py`                  | Command-line utility to interact with the Django project |
| `LibraryProject/settings.py` | Configuration for the Django project                     |
| `LibraryProject/urls.py`     | URL declarations (project-wide routing)                  |
| `LibraryProject/wsgi.py`     | WSGI entry point for deployment                          |
| `LibraryProject/asgi.py`     | ASGI entry point for async capabilities                  |
